Project Overview
This project demonstrates Callback Hell in JavaScript by implementing a basic asynchronous flow with deeply nested callbacks. It serves as an example of how excessive nesting can complicate code readability and maintainability.

Features
Implements a sequence of asynchronous operations using callbacks.
Simulates a real-world asynchronous scenario (e.g., API calls, data fetching, or timed events).
Demonstrates the pitfalls of Callback Hell and why it's important to avoid it.
What is Callback Hell?
Callback Hell refers to the situation where multiple callbacks are nested within one another, leading to complex, unreadable code. This pattern occurs when asynchronous functions are dependent on the results of prior functions, causing deeply nested structures.

Example Structure:
javascript
Copy code
function firstTask(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('First task completed');
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

function secondTask(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('Second task completed');
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

function thirdTask(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log('Third task completed');
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

firstTask(function () {
  secondTask(function () {
    thirdTask(function () {
      console.log('All tasks completed');
    });
  });
});
Challenges Faced (Callback Hell):
Readability: The code becomes harder to understand due to the indentation.
Error Handling: Managing errors across multiple callbacks becomes challenging.
Maintainability: Updating or modifying the code can introduce bugs, making it harder to scale.
How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/callback-hell.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd callback-hell
Run the project using Node.js:
bash
Copy code
node app.js
How to Improve (Avoid Callback Hell)
Promises: Use promises to flatten nested callbacks.
Async/Await: Async functions can improve readability and make error handling easier.
This format will help explain the purpose of the project, demonstrate the issue, and suggest ways to improve it in future implementations.
